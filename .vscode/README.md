# VS Code Configuration Notes

## YAML Schema Validation Issue

### Problem

VS Code's YAML extension shows validation errors for `.golangci.yml`:

- "Missing property 'version'"
- "Property linters-settings is not allowed"
- "Property exclude-rules is not allowed"

### Root Cause

The VS Code YAML extension uses an outdated or incorrect JSON schema for golangci-lint configuration files. The actual golangci-lint tool accepts and validates our configuration correctly.

### Verification

You can verify the configuration is correct by running:

```bash
# Test the configuration
make lint

# Or directly with golangci-lint
golangci-lint run --config .golangci.yml
```

Both should run without errors.

### Solution Attempts

1. **VS Code Workspace Settings** (`.vscode/settings.json`)

   - Disabled YAML validation globally for the workspace
   - Added schema overrides
   - These may reduce but not eliminate the false warnings

2. **YAML Language Server Directive**

   - Added `# yaml-language-server: $schema=null` to disable schema validation for the file

3. **Documentation**
   - Added clear comments in the `.golangci.yml` file explaining the issue

### Recommendation

**Ignore the VS Code YAML validation errors** for `.golangci.yml`. They are cosmetic only and do not affect functionality. The golangci-lint tool itself is the authoritative validator for its configuration format.

### Alternative Solutions

If the warnings are too distracting, you can:

1. Use a different editor for editing `.golangci.yml`
2. Temporarily disable the YAML extension when editing this file
3. Rename the file to `.golangci.yaml` (some report this helps, though not guaranteed)

The configuration is 100% correct and functional as-is.
