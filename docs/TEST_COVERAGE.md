## Test Design Principles

### Unit Tests

- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't rely on external state
- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests complete quickly (< 100ms each)
- **Focused**: Each test verifies a single aspect of functionality
- **Deterministic**: Tests produce consistent results across runs

### Integration Tests

- **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests use real HTTP servers and WebSocket connections
- **Timing Considerations**: Appropriate sleep/wait times for async operations
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper deferred cleanup of connections and servers
- **Error Tolerance**: Tests account for timing variations in concurrent operations

### Security Tests

- **Boundary Conditions**: Tests at, below, and above limits
- **Attack Scenarios**: Tests simulate malicious input patterns
- **Configuration Variations**: Tests different security configurations
- **Combined Constraints**: Tests multiple security features together

## Known Limitations

1. **Integration Test Timing**: Some integration tests rely on sleep statements for synchronization, which can occasionally be flaky in heavily loaded environments.

2. **Mock Limitations**: Unit tests for client read/write pumps are limited because they require real WebSocket connections (tested in integration tests instead).

3. **Coverage Gaps**: Some error paths in connection handling are difficult to test deterministically (e.g., network failures).

## Future Test Improvements

### Potential Additions

- [ ] Load testing with hundreds of concurrent clients
- [ ] Stress testing with rapid connect/disconnect cycles
- [ ] Memory leak detection tests
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Benchmark tests for message throughput

### Test Infrastructure Improvements

- [ ] Add test helpers for common WebSocket client scenarios
- [ ] Implement custom test fixtures for complex multi-client setups
- [ ] Add table-driven tests for security validation scenarios
- [ ] Create mock WebSocket connections for more isolated unit tests

## Conclusion

The GoChat server has comprehensive test coverage across unit tests, integration tests, and security tests. All critical functionality is tested, including:

- Core hub operations (registration, unregistration, broadcasting)
- WebSocket connection management
- Security constraints (origin validation, size limits, rate limiting)
- Error handling and recovery
- Graceful shutdown
- Concurrent operations

The test suite provides confidence in the system's reliability, security, and correctness under various conditions.
