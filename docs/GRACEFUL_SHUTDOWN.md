# Graceful Shutdown & Error Handling Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the graceful shutdown and robust error handling features implemented for the GoChat WebSocket server.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Graceful Shutdown Mechanism

#### Hub Shutdown (`internal/server/hub.go`)

- **Context-Based Shutdown**: Added `context.Context` and `context.CancelFunc` to Hub struct for coordinated shutdown
- **Goroutine Tracking**: Implemented `sync.WaitGroup` to track all client read/write goroutines
- **Shutdown Method**: `Hub.Shutdown(timeout time.Duration)` method that:
  - Signals all goroutines to stop via context cancellation
  - Closes all active client WebSocket connections
  - Waits for all goroutines to terminate (with timeout)
  - Returns error if timeout is exceeded

#### HTTP Server Shutdown (`internal/server/http_server.go`)

- **ShutdownServer Function**: Gracefully shuts down the HTTP server
  - Uses Go's built-in `http.Server.Shutdown()` for graceful connection draining
  - Accepts configurable timeout
  - Logs shutdown progress and completion

#### Main Application Shutdown (`cmd/server/main.go`)

- **Signal Handling**: Listens for OS interrupt signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- **Orderly Shutdown Sequence**:
  1. Receives shutdown signal
  2. Stops accepting new HTTP connections
  3. Gracefully closes all WebSocket connections via Hub shutdown
  4. Waits for all goroutines to complete (with 30s total timeout)
- **Error Handling**: Proper error logging and exit codes

### 2. Robust Error Handling for I/O Operations

#### Enhanced Read Operations (`internal/server/client.go`)

- **Comprehensive Error Categorization**:

  - `websocket.ErrReadLimit`: Message size limit violations
  - `io.EOF`: Normal connection closure
  - `websocket.CloseError`: Graceful close scenarios (normal, going away, abnormal)
  - Unexpected close errors: Logged with full context
  - Generic errors: Logged with descriptive messages

- **Error Context**: All error messages now include client address for better debugging

#### Enhanced Write Operations (`internal/server/client.go`)

- **Write Deadline Errors**: Logged with client context
- **Writer Creation Errors**: Properly handled and logged
- **Message Content Errors**: Detailed error logging for write failures
- **Queued Message Errors**: Individual error handling for each queued message
- **Writer Close Errors**: Logged when writer fails to close properly
- **Ping Errors**: Specific error handling for ping message failures

#### Connection Management

- **Setup Errors**: Read deadline configuration errors are logged
- **Pong Handler Errors**: Errors in keepalive mechanism are logged
- **Close Errors**: Expected vs unexpected close errors are differentiated

### 3. Testing

#### Integration Tests (`test/integration/shutdown_test.go`)

- **TestGracefulShutdown**: Basic hub shutdown without clients
- **TestGracefulShutdownWithClients**: Shutdown with multiple active connections
- **TestShutdownWithActiveMessages**: Verifies message handling during shutdown
- **TestShutdownTimeout**: Validates timeout behavior
- **TestConcurrentShutdown**: Tests multiple simultaneous shutdown calls
- **TestNoClientsShutdown**: Shutdown with no active connections

#### Unit Tests (`test/unit/error_handling_test.go`)

- **TestClientErrorHandling**: Error categorization verification
- **TestHubShutdownContext**: Hub respects shutdown context
- **TestHubShutdownTimeout**: Timeout enforcement
- **TestRecoveryFromPanic**: Panic recovery in send operations

#### Test Helpers (`test/testhelpers/helpers.go`)

- WebSocket connection helpers
- Message sending/receiving utilities
- Proper origin header configuration

## Key Benefits

### 1. No Data Loss

- Graceful shutdown ensures in-flight messages are processed
- Clients receive close notifications before server terminates

### 2. Clean Resource Cleanup

- All goroutines properly terminate
- No goroutine leaks
- WebSocket connections cleanly closed

### 3. Production Ready

- Signal handling for container environments (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Configurable timeouts prevent indefinite hangs
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### 4. Better Debugging

- All error messages include client address
- Error categorization makes diagnosis easier
- Separate logging for expected vs unexpected errors

## Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
./gochat
```

### Graceful Shutdown

Send `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) or `SIGTERM`:

```bash
kill -TERM <pid>
```

The server will:

1. Log "Received shutdown signal"
2. Stop accepting new connections
3. Close all WebSocket connections
4. Wait for goroutines to finish (max 30s)
5. Log "Server stopped gracefully"

### Configuration

Shutdown timeouts can be adjusted in `cmd/server/main.go`:

```go
const shutdownTimeout = 30 * time.Second  // Total timeout
httpServer.Shutdown(15*time.Second)       // HTTP shutdown
hub.Shutdown(15*time.Second)              // Hub shutdown
```

## Error Handling Examples

### Read Errors

```
Message from 127.0.0.1:59593 exceeded maximum size of 64 bytes
Client 127.0.0.1:59593 disconnected: websocket: close 1000 (normal)
WebSocket read error from 127.0.0.1:59593: read tcp: connection reset
```

### Write Errors

```
Error setting write deadline for 127.0.0.1:59593: use of closed connection
Error creating writer for 127.0.0.1:59593: websocket: close sent
Error writing message to 127.0.0.1:59593: broken pipe
```

### Shutdown Logs

```
Received shutdown signal: interrupt
Step 1: Stopping HTTP server...
Shutting down HTTP server...
HTTP server shutdown completed
Step 2: Shutting down WebSocket hub...
Initiating hub shutdown...
Shutting down all client connections...
Closed 5 client connections
Hub shutdown completed successfully
Server stopped gracefully
```

## Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
go test -v ./test/...
```

Run shutdown tests specifically:

```bash
go test -v ./test/integration/shutdown_test.go
```

Run with race detector:

```bash
go test -v -race ./test/...
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. Metrics for shutdown duration
2. Configurable shutdown behavior per environment
3. Graceful degradation under load
4. Connection draining strategies
5. Shutdown hooks for custom cleanup logic

## Compliance

This implementation follows Go best practices:

- Uses `context.Context` for cancellation
- Implements `sync.WaitGroup` for goroutine coordination
- Leverages standard library `signal` package
- Proper error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf`
- Thread-safe operations with mutex protection
